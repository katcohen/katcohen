# Hi 👋  

🎓 Master’s in Financial Management (Investment Analysis concentration)  
📊 Passionate about Fixed Income, Risk Management, and Quantitative Modeling  
💻 Building projects in R and Python: yield curve analysis, risk dashboards, portfolio analytics  

---

With a genuine passion for numbers and economics, I chose to pursue a master’s degree in financial management with a concentration in investment analysis. Through this path, I developed a deep interest in fixed-income markets, where the intersection of macroeconomics, quantitative modeling, and risk management plays a critical role in both investment performance and financial stability.

What excites me most about fixed income is its direct connection to financial risk management—understanding interest rate dynamics, credit risk, and yield curve movements provides a powerful framework for identifying, measuring, and mitigating risk. I am drawn to the way fixed income combines analytical rigor with real-world impact, offering the opportunity to contribute to both portfolio resilience and broader financial market stability.

I am currently working in a failure analysis role, where I apply my analytical and detail-oriented approach to assess risk, identify root causes of events, and leverage predictive modeling to drive meaningful insights and preventative solutions.
